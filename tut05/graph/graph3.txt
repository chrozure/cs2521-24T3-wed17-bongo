How is the adjacency matrix for a directed graph
different to that for an undirected graph?

The adjacency matrix for an undirected graph is symmetric and
has zeroes on the leading diagonal (no self-edges).

The adjacency matrix for a directed graph is typically not symmetric
and can have non-zero values on the leading diagonal (self-edges are allowed).
