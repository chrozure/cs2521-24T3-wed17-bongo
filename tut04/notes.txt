We are 1/3 done with the course! Things are starting to get serious now...

This week we will be looking at ADTs and BSTs.
These stand for Abstract Data Types and Binary Search Trees,
and will be the main topics of your first assignment!


Admin:
    - You can get the handmarking for lab03 done this week or next week
    - There is some handmarking for this week's lab, but it is only worth 1/5.
    - Assignment 1 got released! I doubt anyone has
        looked at it yet so I won't talk too much about it today.


ADTs:
    - An Abstract Data Type is a type of data type where you are given an interface that describes
        how to use it, without telling you how it is implemented "underneath the hood".

    - e.g. driving a car
    - e.g. stacks and queues

    - Why is this useful?
        - It lets us think about our programs at a "higher level"
        - It helps us break down big problems into smaller ones


BSTs:
    - Binary Search Trees are a new data type!
    - They aim to solve the problems that arrays
        and linked lists have:
        - Arrays are hard to resize
        - Linked lists do not have random access, so you cannot do binary search


Assignment 1:
    - The assignment spec can be found on this page:
        - https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2521/24T3/assignments/ass1/

    - Start early!!!
        - When I took COMP2521, I spent almost a whole day just understanding the spec
