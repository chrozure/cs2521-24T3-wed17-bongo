A connected graph is:
    - For every pair of vertices (v, w), there exists a path
        from v to w.

A complete graph is:
    - For every pair of vertices (v, w) there exists an edge
        connecting v to w

Which of these implications are true? How could you prove/disprove them?
    connected => complete?
    complete => connected?
