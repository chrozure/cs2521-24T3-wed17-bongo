Welcome back! Hope you all had a good flexi week :)
Congrats on finishing assignment 1!

We briefly introduced graphs in week 5.
This week we will be looking at some graph traversals and problems.

The depth-first search algorithm is arguably one of the most important
algorithms in all of computer science, and both this week's lab and
assignment 2 will involve a lot of graph traversals.

Admin:
    - You can get handmarking done for lab04, lab05 and lab07 (fully handmarked)
    - Assignment 2 was released today, and the lecture
        today gave a brief introduction to it.
