dfs(G, src):
    Input: graph G, vertex src

    create visited array, initialised to false
    create predecessor array, initialised to -1
    create stack S

    push src onto S

    while S is not empty:
        pop v from S
        if v has been visited:
            continue

        mark v as visited

        for each neighbour w of v:
            if w has not been visited:
                set predecessor of w to v
                push w onto S
