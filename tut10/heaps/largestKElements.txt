a. A simple way to solve this problem is to sort the array in increasing order,
and then the largest k elements would be the last k elements of the sorted array.
What is the worst-case time complexity of this approach?



b. Come up with a more efficient method that uses a heap.
What is the worst-case time complexity of this method?
