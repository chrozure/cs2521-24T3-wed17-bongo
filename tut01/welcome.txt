Hello everyone and welcome to COMP2521 for 24T3!!

My name is Harry, and I'm a fourth year studying Computer Science and Science (maths)!
I will be your tutor for this term, and Kane will be our lab assistant!

This course is a step up from COMP1511, where we build on the fundamentals and focus on
    ** how to write programs that scale **

Content covered in this course will be used in basically every other COMP
course and even in your job interviews!!
