Welcome to week 3!

In this tutorial we will be focusing on sorting algorithms!
Sorting algorithms are used everywhere, but you probably have never thought too much about it.

Admin stuff:
    - This week is the last week you can get lab01 marked!

    - In this week's lab, there is no coding but you will instead need to write up a report
    - lab03 is fully handmarked, and you have until week 5 to get it handmarked
        but you MUST submit it by next Monday!
    - You can also do lab03 in pairs!


Sorting algorithms:
    - Here is a cool video which helps you visualise (and audiolize) various sorting algorithms:

    - This website allows you to look at the step-by-step process for sorting:

Time complexity revision:
    - Here is a Kahoot made by one of our tutors, Patrick, that tests your understanding of big O!
