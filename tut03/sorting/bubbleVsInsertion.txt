Let's compare the performance of bubble sort vs insertion sort!

Bubble Sort:
    - Goes through the array, checking all the adjacent pairs.
      Until the array is in sorted order:
        If a pair is not in the correct order:
          Swap them around

    - Best case: O(n)
    - Worst case: O(n^2)

Insertion sort:
    - Split the array into a sorted an unsorted section.
      As you move towards the right, insert each new element into its correct position

    - Best case: O(n)
    - Worst case: O(n^2)


1. Sorted input
Bubble sort:
    1 2 3 4 5

Insertion sort:
    1|2 3 4 5



2. Reverse-sorted
Bubble sort:
    5 4 3 2 1

Insertion sort:
    5|4 3 2 1



3. Sorted, except the first and last elements are swapped
Bubble sort:
    5 2 3 4 1

Insertion sort:
    5|2 3 4 1
